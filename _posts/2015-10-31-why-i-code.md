Most people who become journalists or novelists or haiku writers have some talent at stringing words together in a way that seems not only meaningful to them but to other people.

The ones who become "good" at this craft, though, are the people with courage. Not to go drive through a war zone, though I've done that, but to face what we call "the blank page."

And for developers, there is nothing like that cursor blinking back at you when you have no idea where to start.

Like this blog post. But look, I started somewhere. The end.
